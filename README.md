# Module-Federation
Module Federation example using webpack

Micro-frontends help us break large frontend applications into smaller independent applications or modules that can be built and deployed at their cadence.

Doing this using Module Federation allows us to combine the applications at run time in the clientâ€™s browsers and eliminate build-time dependencies and coordination, allowing the teams building these applications to develop at scale.

Sharing of the modules becomes really easy with this approach.
